## Overview
This Sales Data Analysis Project, undertaken as part of a Data Innovators Challenge, addresses a series of business questions categorized into three progressively challenging levels. 

Level 1: Basic Insights
Focused on identifying key performance indicators (KPIs), statistical metrics, and basic data summaries. This level establishes a solid understanding of the dataset.

Level 2: Intermediate Insights
Investigates relationships and correlations among variables to uncover trends and patterns within the data.

Level 3: Critical Thinking Insights
Tackles complex business questions requiring deep analysis, logical reasoning, and interpretation to provide strategic insights.

 This project aims to solve the 3 levels of business questions by building an interactive dashboard in Power BI and dives deeper to find more insights and recommendations.
